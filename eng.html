              <div class="about__text">
                The monastery is located in Israel near the ancient city of Capernaum on the northwest coast of the Sea of Tiberias (now the Sea of Galilee) in Galilee, Israel. Jesus Christ preached in the synagogue of Capernaum and performed many miracles in this city. The Cathedral of St. Luke, consecrated in 1987, is located on the monastery grounds. There are also male dormitories for pilgrims.

                The monastery always observes winter time. Therefore, services start at different times in the summer and winter periods.

                 Festive and celebratory services are performed in the Cathedral of All Saints who Shone in the Russian Land. Ordinary services are held in the Temple of St. Luke at different times.

            Relatives searched everywhere for the missing Alexy, but without success. Servants sent by Euphymian to search visited Edessa, but did not recognize their master in the poor man sitting on the pavement. His body had dried up from strict fasting, his beauty had disappeared, and his sight had become weak. The Blessed One recognized them and thanked the Lord for receiving alms from his servants.
          </div>
          <div class="about__text">
            The body of the saint, from which healings began to occur, was placed in the middle of the square. The entire city of Rome gathered here. The emperor and the pope themselves carried the saint's body into the church, where it remained for a whole week before being placed in a marble tomb. Fragrant oil began to flow from the holy relics, which brought healing to the sick.

              <div class="about__text">
                Saint Alexis was born in Rome into a family of pious
                 ungodly-loving Euthymian and Aglaida. The couple have been for a long time
                 childless and tirelessly prayed to the Lord for the gift of offspring. AND
                 The Lord consoled the couple with the birth of their son Alexy. At six years old
                 the lad began to study and successfully studied secular sciences, but especially
                 diligently read the Holy Scriptures. As a young man, he began
                 imitate their parents: strictly fasted, distributed alms and
                 under rich clothes he secretly wore a sackcloth. It ripened early
                 desire to leave the world and serve the One God. However, parents
                 were going to marry Alexy and, when he came of age,
                 found him a bride.
              </div>
              <div class="about__text">
                After the betrothal, left alone with his bride in the evening,
                 Alexy removed the ring from his finger, gave it to her and said: "Keep this,
                 and may the Lord be with us, by His grace arranging for us
                 new life." And he himself secretly left home and boarded a ship,
                 sailed to Mesopotamia.
              </div>
              <div class="about__text">
                Once in the city of Edessa, where the image of the Lord not made by hands was kept,
                 Alexy sold everything he had, distributed money to the poor and became
                 live at the Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary on the porch and feed
                 alms. The reverend ate only bread and water, and
                 He distributed the alms he received to the weak and the elderly. Each
                 On Sunday he received the Holy Mysteries.
              </div>
              <div class="about__text">
                Relatives searched everywhere for the missing Alexy, but to no avail. Servants,
                 sent by Euthymian to search, they also visited Edessa, but did not
                 recognized in the beggar, sitting on the porch, their master. From
                 strict fasting, his body dried up, beauty disappeared, vision became
                 weak. The blessed one recognized them and thanked the Lord for
                 received alms from his servants.
              </div>
              <div class="about__text">
                The body of the saint from whom the healings began was
                 placed in the middle of the square. All Rome gathered here. Emperor and
                 The Pope themselves brought the body of the saint into the church where it was
                 for a whole week, and then was laid in a marble tomb. From
                 holy relics began to flow fragrant myrrh, giving
                 healing for the sick.
              </div>
              <div class="about__text">
                The honest remains of St. Alexis, the man of God, are buried in
                 Church of Saint Boniface. In 1216 relics were found.
